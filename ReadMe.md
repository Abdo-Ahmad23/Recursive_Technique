# Key topics covered include:

  - Basic Recursion: Simple problems such as calculating the factorial of a number, Fibonacci series, and sum of digits.
  - Divide and Conquer: Recursion-based algorithms like merge sort and quicksort.
  - Backtracking: Problems like generating permutations, combinations, and solving the N-Queens problem.
  - Dynamic Programming with Recursion: Memoization techniques to optimize recursive solutions, such as solving the Knapsack problem and longest common subsequence.
  - Tree Traversal: Recursive algorithms for traversing binary trees (inorder, preorder, and postorder).

# Each example includes both C++ and Python implementations, showing how recursion can be efficiently implemented in both languages:

  - C++: Known for its performance and control over memory, making it ideal for deep recursive solutions.
  - Python: Offers simplicity and a clean syntax, making recursive solutions easy to write and understand.
